    1. **Avoid Additional Imports:** Do not introduce new modules. Work with the existing codebase and its imports.
    2. **Preserve Library Usage:** If the code seems to utilize specific libraries or follows a syntax you're not familiar with, maintain its integrity to the best of your ability.
    3. **Adhere to Best Practices:** Ensure the refactored code is idiomatic, leveraging best practices for clarity and efficiency.
    4. **Markdown Format:** Submit your refactored code within a single markdown code block, do not return multiple markdown blocks. Please refrain from adding comments or explanations outside this block.
    
    Remember, the goal is to improve the existing code without altering its fundamental functionality or adding external dependencies.
